# OpenCV
OpenCV related demos and face recognition files


1. Familiarize yourself with Unix/Linux terminal [commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html)
2. Installation of OpenCV
   -  [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/28/macos-install-opencv-3-and-python-2-7/#comment-413944)
         - Note: I personally had trouble installing OpenCV on my Mac, but Adrian Rosebrock, person who started PyImageSearch, was very helpful. In fact, this was first time I submitted online question and he was very quick with response.
   -  [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U49CVY8yOxw) tutorial on how to install OpenCV
   - Official OpenCV [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) with some tutorials

### Face Recognition
- My favorite: [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#face-recognition) package that uses dlib
    - Install Dlib: based on my [github](https://github.com/AlmasM/EmotionDetection#installing-face-recognition-package-using-dlib) "tutorial"
- Buidling Face Recognition using Python and OpenCV by [Bikramjot Singh Hanzra](http://hanzratech.in/2015/02/03/face-recognition-using-opencv.html). Great Face Recognition tutorial for those who just started to learn. 
- [Face Detection using Haar Featured-based Cascade Classifiers](https://github.com/rragundez/PyData/blob/master/notebooks_tutorial/02_Face_Detection_and_Building_the_Dataset.ipynb) is another great tutorial (with video) by Rragundez for those that just started learning.
- OpenFace
    - [Face Recognition](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface) with deep neural network based on Dlib and Torch
    - [OpenFace 0.3.0](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) facial behavior analysis package
- Image recognition package by [Google](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition#usage_with_python_api) using Tensorflow
- [Deep Video Analytics](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/DeepVideoAnalytics) allows to extracting certain information from videos and images
- [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/tree/ee5de933815e5b7cc25a646fe23e5f0d076e795c) that uses TensorFlow to recognize faces


### Additional Notes
- [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/index) is one of the largest image database online. One of the people who worked on this project is Fei Fei Li. Fun fact you can watch her [TedEx](https://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures) video 
- [Imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) series of functions that help to manipulate images (i.e. rotation, color change, resizing). 
- I highly recommend [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com) as it has free installation guides that are very hands-on.
